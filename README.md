# fire-detector
# Goal of this project was to develop a simple prototype which is wokring smoothly!
# Used HW: Arduino Uno, Microphone sensor KY-038, RGB, DC/DC Converter, SIM800L, Prepaid Sim Card, Vibration Motor, Button
# Prototype realizes the following uses cases: Microphone sensor recognizes and differentiates three acoustic sounds: standard fire alarm, # doorbell and random environmental noises.
# Output:
# - In case of fire -> red RGB + constant vibration + sms is sent-> press button required to stop vibration and set RGB back to white
# - In case of doorbell -> green LED + 3x vibration -> RGB is set back to white
# - nothing is happening -> LED is white and nothing is happening

# For pictures etc, just contact me!
